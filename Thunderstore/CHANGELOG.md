| 1.0.5     | - The base game allows you to set custom keys (add and remove). They also appear to do so themselves with the `defeated_queen` and other keys...but not for the other bosses (those use the internal keys enum). Weird way to do things...but, the mod now can handle custom keys being set/used.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1.0.4     | - Fix issue joining server if mod is client only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 1.0.3     | - Add configuration options for Global keys, if it should use them at all.<br/> - Make the mod less "destructive" now that we have to be able to dynamically determine mist. Now it simply turns on and off the mist emitters based on your configuration.<br/> - Add ServerSync for these configuration values.<br/> - Give a detailed breakdown of what should happen when installed client only, server only, all clients and server, some clients and server in the README. |
